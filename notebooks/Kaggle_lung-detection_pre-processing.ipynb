One metadata field is missing, the pixel size in the Z direction, which is the slice thickness. Fortunately we can infer this, and we add this to the metadata."

    "Anyway, when you want to use this mask, **remember to first apply a dilation morphological operation** on it (i.e. with a circular kernel).  This expands the mask in all directions. The air + structures in the lung alone will not contain all nodules, in particular it will miss those that are stuck to the side of the lung, where they often appear! So expand the mask a little :)\n",

    "**This segmentation may fail for some edge cases**. It relies on the fact that the air outside the patient is not connected to the air in the lungs. If the patient has a [tracheostomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracheotomy), this will not be the case, I do not know whether this is present in the dataset. Also, particulary noisy images (for instance due to a pacemaker in the image below) this method may also fail. Instead, the second largest air pocket in the body will be segmented. You can recognize this by checking the fraction of image that the mask corresponds to, which will be very small for this case. You can then first apply a morphological closing operation with a kernel a few mm in size to close these holes, after which it should work (or more simply, do not use the mask for this image). \n",
